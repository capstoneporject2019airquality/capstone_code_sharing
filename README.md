### Project Abstract:
Salt Lake County oversees a vehicle emissions testing program to ensure compliance with federal air quality standards. Motorists annually spend millions of dollars for inspections carried out under this program. However, it is not subject to cost controls and suffers from programmatic inefficiencies wherein a large number of compliant vehicles undergo testing and a small number of high-polluting vehicles forgo timely repair. Using survey-based emissions test pricing data, we assess through empirical and spatial autocorrelation analysis the potential economic impact of instituting both emissions test price caps and subsidies to fund compliance repairs. Our results indicate testing providers have an overall negative view towards regulatory price caps but a majority would voluntarily participate in a subsidized repair program. Following completion of the project, we anticipate Salt Lake County regulators will better understand where the testing program experiences cost inefficiencies and the impact on test providers and motorists of introducing price cap and repair subsidies. If demonstrated to increase cost efficiencies and increases in pollution-reducing repairs, local programmatic improvements like these often serve as powerful examples of change other localities are quick to emulate.
